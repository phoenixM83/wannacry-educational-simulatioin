# -educational-simulatioin
educational simulation of ransomware behavioir for cybersecurity study
# – educational simulation (Python)

## ⚠️ Educational Disclaimer
This project is a **purely educational simulation** inspired by the WannaCry ransomware attack.

- This project does NOT encrypt real system files
- It does NOT self-propagate
- It does NOT use networking
- It does NOT cause harm
- It is intended strictly for cybersecurity learning

##🎯 Objective
To demonstrate, in a safe and ethical way, how ransomware logic works:
- File encryption
- Decryption using a key
- Understanding attacker methodology
## Technologies
- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries

## 📁 Project Structure
- encrypt_simulation.py → Simulates file encryption (educational)
- decrypt_simulation.py → Simulates file decryption
- sample_data.txt → Sample file used in the simulation

## 📚 Learning Focus
- Encryption concepts
- Ethical cybersecurity research
- Malware behavior analysis (non-operational)
